## LEARNING PLAN
1. Simple switch:
    * ./ryu/app/example_switch_13.py
    * ./ryu/app/simple_switch_13.py
2. **[DONE]** Ensure that L2 Dumb switch is working
3. REST API
4. Link aggregation example
5. OpenFlow API:   
   * trace receiving messages during negotiation phases
   * also trace: negotiation phase change notification by handling the EventOFPStateChange event
   * EventOFPPortStateChange VS EventOFPPortStatus
6. *[OPTIONAL]* Packet parser library: http://ryu.readthedocs.org/en/latest/library_packet.html
7. Work with ryu.controller.dpset.Events (handle switch (dis)connecting)
8. Understand the ryu.controller.network.EventNetworkXXX (events generated by REST API)


## HOW-TO
1. sudo apt-get install mininet
   Test: sudo mn --test pingall                                             (a)
         sudo mn --topo single,3 --mac --switch ovsk --controller remote    (b)
   
   Tip: For both (a) & (b), the ovs-vswitchd service must be launched
        During (b), MN try to connect remote controller at localhost:6633 (6633 is OpenFlow port)
        As no controller is launched:
        a) there is a message: "Unable to contact the remote controller..."
        b) pingall fails

2. cd ryu && PYTHONPATH=.
   ./bin/ryu-manager ryu/app/simple_switch.py

   Now connection is established between MN switch & Ryu controller - pingall should be passed

3. Dump flows for switch s1: sudo ovs-ofctl -O OpenFlow13 dump-flows s1

4. To launch integrated tests:
   - sudo pip install nose


## PROBLEMS & OPEN QUESTIONS

1. Did the 'openvswitch-switch' package installed automatically with mininet? Check on a clear machine
2. Check MN with ovs-testcontroller

## LEARNING PLAN
1. **[DONE]** Simple switch (see ./ryu/app/simple_switch_13.py)
2. **[DONE]** Ensure that L2 Dumb switch is working

3. REST API:
    ./ryu/app/ofctl_rest.py

4. Link aggregation example
5. OpenFlow API:   
   * trace receiving messages during negotiation phases
   * also trace: negotiation phase change notification by handling the EventOFPStateChange event
   * EventOFPPortStateChange VS EventOFPPortStatus
6. *[OPTIONAL]* Packet parser library: http://ryu.readthedocs.org/en/latest/library_packet.html
7. Work with ryu.controller.dpset.Events (handle switch (dis)connecting)
8. Understand the ryu.controller.network.EventNetworkXXX (events generated by REST API)
9. ryu/app/gui_topology/gui_topology.py
10. Integrate Ryu with Suricata, similarly as with Snort (ryu/app/simple_switch_snort.py)
